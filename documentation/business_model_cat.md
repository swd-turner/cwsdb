The purpose of this document is to explain what each of these categories means. Terminology and definitions are taken from source **Bakker2002**.

Government utility (gvt\_utility)
---------------------------------

#### Asset ownership: ***Municipal or regional government***

#### Asset operation: ***Municipal or regional administration***

The utility is owned and operated by a municipal government, or a group of municipal governments. The municipal government (usually a specific government department) is responsible for operating and maintaining assets, as well as for planning and investing in new assets. Revenues are generated through property tax or user fees, with rates set by the municipal government, often based on recommendations of national regulatory agency. The government utility model predominates in the industrialized countries.

Delegated management (delegated\_man)
-------------------------------------

#### Asset ownership: ***Municipal or regional government***

#### Asset operation: ***Separate delegated enetities***

The utility is owned by the municipal or regional government, but various core parts of the operation are contracted out to separate entities, including private companies. Delegated parts of the operation may include construction, operation, maintainance, and customer service functions. This is done through a combination of service contracts (1-2 yrs), build-own-operate contracts, lease agreements and concessions. (See Mexico City / Buenon Aires).

---------------------------------------------

#### Asset ownership: ***Municipal government***
